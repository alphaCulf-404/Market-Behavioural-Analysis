If the model is having some hidden, not observable parameters, then we should use GMM.

GMM produce non-convex clusters, which can be controlled with the variance of the distribution. In fact, k-Means is a special case of GMM, such that the probability of a one point to belong to a certain cluster is 1, and all other probabilities are 0, and the variance is 1, which is a reason why k-Means produces only spherical clusters.\n\n3. GMM allows for mixed membership of points to clusters. In kmeans, a point belongs to one and only one cluster, whereas in GMM a point belongs to each cluster to a different degree. The degree is based on the probability of the point being generated from each clusterâ€™s (multivariate) normal distribution, with cluster center as the distributionâ€™s mean and cluster covariance as its covariance. Depending on the task, mixed membership may be more appropriate (e.g. news articles can belong to multiple topic clusters) or not (e.g. organisms can belong to only one species)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ad1e6133b8d113634e2465f7e1c005e1532dedb9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Creating Clusters"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6dfc16db5fc4d90ef6efff4d15537da8b4a6a27c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known.
